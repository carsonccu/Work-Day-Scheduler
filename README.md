# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This schedule planner is designed to allow users to enter in a list of things that must be done during the day and a time to complete them by. This project allows a user to stay organized and up to date on whether they are falling behind or ahead of schedule. I learned a lot about local storage and how to store each description and display it back to the user even on refresh. The hardest part of this project was the storage and how to get my items to save.

## Installation

In this project we were required to create a schedule planner. The planner should include the hours of the current day. To get the current day moment.js is needed in order to format correctly. Next in each description you will be able to fill out your "TODO's" for that day and on the webpage refresh your "TODO's" they should be saved in your local storage. Finally by using bootstrap and CSS your page is formatted to display colors based on the given time, past time, and future times.
